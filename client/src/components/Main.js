              Artist Galy is a self-taught prodigy in the field of 3D art.
              Reimagining familiar characters with naughty twists and bad
              habits, Galyâ€™s art continues to evolve with his inspirations. His
              latest designs are meant to exist in his fantasy version of a dark
              cartoon universe.
